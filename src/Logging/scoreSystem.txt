Max Score per week: 10000

Options:
Partial Scoring for completing most of the objective.
Bonus points - finish with time left, getting it exactly or really close to 8:00, swish shots in brainstormer, etc
	- Will need to cut after each minigame to show how they are getting the points, not just a random +120 instead of +100
	
Would need to raise the point thresholds if either of these options are used.
